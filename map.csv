1,Commonland,15,Commonland logo,img/commonland.jpg,Source: Commonland,https://www.commonland.com,"Commonland was founded in 2013 with the ambition to kick-start a landscape restoration 
economy based on the 4 returns framework. With the support of the COmON Foundation, 
Commonland was able to develop landscape restoration projects in four countries, to 
start educating the next generation of business leaders and to build a core team. Within 
this short period Commonland has earned an international reputation as an innovative 
change maker. In the coming five years Commonland will enter a new phase as a mature 
organization that demonstrates that the 4 returns framework can be implemented at scale, 
by inspiring and working together with others. Commonland aims to further realize its 
project activities on the ground, increase its client-based partnerships, continue business 
education, and work on outreach and acquisition of funding for all our activities. The 
Commonland Foundation is the engine to make this all happen. We aim to further build 
and strengthen the organisation, creating resilient teams, structures and processes to 
optimize all of our partnerships.",52.4046722,4.8852656,
2,AlVelAl in Spain,17,Spanish project landscape,img/spain.jpg,Source: Commonland,https://www.commonland.com,"Large opportunities lie in the restoration of the Western Australian Wheatbelt. Our goal is to transform this degraded and depopulated landscape by developing inspirational solutions that will create new jobs and business opportunities; secure local food supplies; and restore biodiversity, soil and water quality. Doing so, we believe we can convert the Wheatbelt into a world-class sustainable Foodbelt.

Failure to attract investment to the Wheatbelt up to now has resulted in a stagnation of the innovation of farming and land care practices. The area is over-cleared, depopulating, and the remaining family farmers are under significant financial pressure. They are often trapped in a cycle of debt that forces them to apply conventional, chemically-dependent farming practices.

Commonland’s business partner Wide Open Agriculture is a future-focused company that has identified innovative solutions to regenerate the Wheatbelt landscape and its economy. These solutions include: innovative ecologically based farming practices enabled by sustainable water management systems; measures to restore the soils and biodiversity; bringing migrants – the ‘new Australians’ – to the area as employees or business partners; and an approach to scale-up, through listing on the Australian Stock Exchange, which would make it possible to attract equity from retail and institutional investors.
